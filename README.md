# Holonomic-drives
  
This repo contains all the different types of drives that i have worked on. It will be a basic interface for running them using a ps3 dualshock 4 controller or a xbox 360 controller. The basic algorithm still remains the same. It will also contain the following  
  
  1. Vector calculations for the drive wheels  
  2. Forward and inverse kinematic documents to derive the equation in which the parameters will only be the following  
     a.Input = Desired direction and velocity of the drive  
     b.Output = Direction and PWM of each wheel  
  3. Solidworks model of the drive including parts and assembly files supported for Solidworks 2016.(For any other version please              contact me or refer to my grabcad page)  
      
Please note that due to confidentiality reasons, I can not put the entire source code of the robot here, this is strictly restricted the the basic code for running the drive only.
